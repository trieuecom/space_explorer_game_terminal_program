'''
game.py â€” Space Exploration Game Module

The game module runs the space exploration game.

It coordinates gameplay by integrating the map functionality from space_map.py
and the Ship class from ship.py. This module initialises the space exploration
map and ship, and runs the game where players issue commands to explore the 
map, interact with entities, and aim to reach the destination.

    # 3. Game Loop
    # - At this stage, you should have both a map and ship initialised
    # - Take in commands from user to navigate map and progress the game
    # - You'll need to make frequent use of both your map and ship!
    #    - Your ship stores (x, y): This is [y][x] on the map!
    #    - When you find where the ship wants to move, call its interact()
    #      method!
    # - After each interaction, you'll need to check win/loss conditions
    #    - Check if ship reached destination (remember ship stores this!)
    #    - Check if ship has no health
    #    - Check if ship has no fuel left
