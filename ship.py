'''
ship.py â€” Ship Module

This module defines the Ship class used in the space exploration game.

The Ship class encapsulates all functionality related to the player's ship,
including the ship's current state (position, fuel, health, and minerals)
and methods to manage movement, resource consumption, interactions with map
entities and displaying status reports.

        The interaction varies depending on the type of entity. Each

        minerals, etc).

        Parameters:
